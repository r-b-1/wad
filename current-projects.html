      <p>This is the page where I'll have some of my projects.</p>
      <p>I have a handful of some that I would consider resume/website worthy for example</p>
      <p>Bloc Party!!!</p>
      <p>Bloc Party was a group project where we had a semester to make a android application. My group choose to make a app similer to facebook market place where users could share items in order to give access to tools and items to more people while also saving the environment!</p>

      <p>So I thought this was pretty neat, I was doing some research on the International Space Station and I found this sick website that has a widget that anyone can use!</p>
