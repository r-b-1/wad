        <p>Here is a page where I can put some of my personal interests and hobbies.</p>
        <p>One thing that I reeally want to get done as well is start using Quartz so that I can include my school notes here as well as make some additions to the website more seamlessly.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned in my home page, I like researching on github and finding projects that I find interesting. Here are some that I like and have been testing:</p>
        <p>py-clash-bot: This is a project written in python with the goal of automating the task of playing the game clash royale. It has functionality to upgrade cards, do card mastery, and even battle other players!</p>
        <p>openclaw: This is a really neat open source ai tool that is like having your own irl version of jarvis. You cand hook it to many different things such as macos reminders or messages and you can even chat with it from anywhere using telegram or slack!</p>

        <p>Also id like to put this here, originally I was upset about darnold leaving the vikings and now making it to the superbowl but now I've been thinking about it and he deserves the win. I want to see him win the MVP too after going from team to team and making a huge comeback in his career.</p>
        <p>I also believe that the gatorade will be purple, lol.</p>

        <p>Just got passed the NBA trade deadline and wow, antetokumpo didnt get traded but we traded away rob dillingham and leonnard miller so thats kinda sad but we got ayo dosunmo</p>
