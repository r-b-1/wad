# Website Enhancement Ideas

A checklist of ideas to make the website more distinctive while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.

## Interactive & Dynamic Elements

- [x] Typewriter effect - Animate "Hi, my name is Jack" letter-by-letter on first load
- [x] Smooth fade-in animations - Have paragraphs gently fade in as you scroll down
- [ ] Enhanced hover states - Try subtle color shifts, slight movements, or scale effects on links
- [ ] Custom cursor - A simple dot trail or custom pointer
- [ ] Parallax effect on lake photo - Make it move slightly slower than text when scrolling

## Visual Personality

- [ ] Paper texture overlay - Subtle grain or paper texture on background for depth
- [ ] Dark mode toggle - Offer a dark alternative to the cream theme
- [ ] More photos/visuals - Add screenshots of Bloc Party app, workspace, other projects
- [ ] ASCII art header - Simple ASCII drawing of name or signature element
- [ ] Color accents - Add one accent color for special elements

## Content Widgets (Personality++)

- [ ] "Now" section - Small box showing what you're currently working on/playing/reading
- [ ] GitHub contribution graph - Embed GitHub activity chart
- [ ] Spotify "Now Playing" widget - Show what music you're listening to
- [ ] Random quote/thought rotator - Different message each visit
- [ ] Visitor counter - Old-school retro style

## Unique Layout Ideas

- [ ] Horizontal scrolling section - Maybe for projects page
- [ ] Floating timestamp - Clock could float and follow scroll, or pulse on updates
- [ ] Side annotations - Small notes/thoughts in margins like visible footnotes
- [ ] Split sections - Half text, half image layouts for variety

## Easter Eggs & Hidden Touches

- [x] Console messages - Fun message when someone opens browser dev tools
- [ ] Konami code - Secret unlock for something silly
- [ ] Hover surprises - Hidden tooltips with extra thoughts/jokes
- [ ] Random background variations - Slight hue shifts on each visit (still cream family)

## Quick Wins

- [ ] Better link previews - Add actual links to Bloc Party repo, GitHub projects mentioned
- [ ] Changelog/Updates section - Document site changes over time
- [ ] Loading states - Fun loading message before ISS widget loads
- [ ] Keyboard navigation - Press 1/2/3 to jump between pages

## Top Priority (Recommended Starting Points)

- [x] **Typewriter effect** on opening line (immediate personality)
- [x] **Subtle fade-in animations** (polish without complexity)
- [x] **Console easter egg** (shows coding personality to people who'd appreciate it)
