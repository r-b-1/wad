        <p>Here is a page where I can put some of my personal interests and hobbies.</p>
        <p>One thing that I really want to get done is start using Quartz so that I can include my school notes here as well as make additions to the website more seamlessly.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned on my home page, I like browsing GitHub and finding projects that I find interesting. Here are some that I like and have been testing:</p>
        <p><strong>py-clash-bot</strong> - A project written in Python with the goal of automating the game Clash Royale. It has functionality to upgrade cards, do card mastery, and even battle other players.</p>
        <p><strong>OpenClaw</strong> - A really neat open source AI tool that is like having your own version of Jarvis. You can hook it up to many different things such as macOS Reminders or Messages, and you can even chat with it from anywhere using Telegram or Slack.</p>

        <p>I was originally upset about Darnold leaving the Vikings and making it to the Super Bowl, but he deserved the win. Going from team to team and making a huge comeback in his career was impressive to watch.</p>

        <p>Just got past the NBA trade deadline - Antetokounmpo didn't get traded but we traded away Rob Dillingham and Leonard Miller, so that's a bit sad. We did get Ayo Dosunmu though.</p>
