        <p>Hi, my name is Jack. I’m best reached via <a href="mailto:oiendjack@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>

        <p>I try to be present, but you will find me allotting a large sum of my time attempting to figure out how things work. Whether its diving into someones code, taking apart electronics, or just watching videos on how others organize and live their lives</p>

        <p>I currently work at a gym but I've been applying to multiple companies in hopes of acquiring an internship for this summer.</p>

        <p>I want this website to be something big so I want to put more effort and try to make this nicer, kinda like decorating a room. Maybe more like a minimalistic room, more or less but whatever.</p>

        <p>I'll put a picture here, like a little photo in a picture frame in a house!</p>

        <p>Here! I got the perfect one.</p>

        <img alt="This is a image of a lake on a sunny day, with reeds and lilypads in the foreground." src="lake_photo_1.jpeg" class="center-image">

        <p>Here is a photo I took on the 4th of July this last year.</p>

        <p>Also i might make a new page later to include some things I enjoy doing but for now ill just put them here.</p>
        <p>I spend a lot of time playing this game called <a href="https://www.milkywayidle.com/#">milkywayidle</a> and it is a rabbit hole for sure.</p>
